# Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) 

## Single-User MIMO (SU-MIMO)

See the python notebook [here](notebooks/mimo.ipynb) - or through nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ghozlan/mimo/blob/master/notebooks/mimo.ipynb) for better rendering - which compares
the information rates over SU-MIMO channel  for:
* Optimal receiver
* Matched Filter (MF) receiver
* Zero Forcing (ZF) receiver
* Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) receiver

Perfect channel state information at the receiver is assumed.
